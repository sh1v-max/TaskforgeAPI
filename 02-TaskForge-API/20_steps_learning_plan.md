## The 20-Step Roadmap

---

### Phase 1: Environment & Setup Review
Before writing new features, we will ensure our environment is ready and install the necessary tools to level up our application.

**Step 1: Codebase Review & Package Installation**
*   **What to work on:** Review existing `package.json` and install new dependencies.
*   **How to implement:** Run `npm i cors helmet express-rate-limit express-async-handler`.
*   **Why:** These packages are crucial for security (CORS, Helmet, Rate Limiting) and keeping our controllers clean (Async Handler).

**Step 2: Setup Global App Security Basics**
*   **What to work on:** Update `src/app.js` to include basic security middleware.
*   **How to implement:** Import and apply `cors()` and `helmet()` before defining any routes.
*   **Why:** Protects against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and allows the frontend to communicate with your API.

---

### Phase 2: Task Model & Database Relationship
We need a place to store tasks in the database and tie them securely to individual users.

**Step 3: Define the Task Mongoose Schema**
*   **What to work on:** Create `src/models/Task.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Define a Mongoose schema with `title` (String, required), `description` (String), `status` (Enum: pending, in-progress, completed), and `dueDate` (Date).
*   **Why:** Tells MongoDB exactly how task data should be structured.

**Step 4: Establish the User-Task Database Relationship**
*   **What to work on:** Update `src/models/Task.js` to link tasks to users.
*   **How to implement:** Add a `user` field of type `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` with `ref: 'User'` and `required: true`.
*   **Why:** Ensures every task is owned by a specific user, preventing users from viewing other people's data.

---

### Phase 3: Data Validation
Never trust data coming from the client. We will use Zod to validate data before it hits our database.

**Step 5: Create Zod Schema for Task Creation**
*   **What to work on:** Create `src/schemas/task.schema.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Define `createTaskSchema` validating `title` (min length), `status`, and `dueDate`.
*   **Why:** Validates the request body so controllers only deal with guaranteed clean data.

**Step 6: Create Zod Schema for Task Update**
*   **What to work on:** Add `updateTaskSchema` to `src/schemas/task.schema.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Similar to creation, but using `.optional()` for fields since a user might only update the title or only the status.

---

### Phase 4: Core Task Controllers (CRUD Operations)
This is the heart of the API where the business logic lives.

**Step 7: Implement `createTask` Controller**
*   **What to work on:** Create `src/controllers/task.controller.js` and write the `createTask` function.
*   **How to implement:** Extract `req.body` and attach `user: req.user.id` (which comes from the auth middleware). Save using `Task.create()`.
*   **Why:** Allows users to add new tasks.

**Step 8: Implement `getTasks` Controller (Read All)**
*   **What to work on:** Add `getTasks` function in the controller.
*   **How to implement:** Use `Task.find({ user: req.user.id })`.
*   **Why:** Fetches all tasks belonging **only** to the currently logged-in user.

**Step 9: Implement `getTaskById` Controller (Read Single)**
*   **What to work on:** Add `getTaskById` function.
*   **How to implement:** Use `Task.findOne({ _id: req.params.id, user: req.user.id })`. 
*   **Why:** Retrieves a specific task, ensuring the user actually owns it before returning it.

**Step 10: Implement `updateTask` Controller**
*   **What to work on:** Add `updateTask` function.
*   **How to implement:** Use `Task.findOneAndUpdate({ _id: req.params.id, user: req.user.id }, req.body, { new: true })`.
*   **Why:** Updates a task and returns the newly updated document.

**Step 11: Implement `deleteTask` Controller**
*   **What to work on:** Add `deleteTask` function.
*   **How to implement:** Use `Task.findOneAndDelete({ _id: req.params.id, user: req.user.id })`.
*   **Why:** Safely removes a task from the database.

---

### Phase 5: Routing & Protection
Connecting our controllers to actual HTTP endpoints and protecting them.

**Step 12: Wire up Task Routes**
*   **What to work on:** Create `src/routes/task.router.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Create an Express router and map the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP methods to their respective controller functions.

**Step 13: Apply Auth & Validation Middleware**
*   **What to work on:** Update `src/routes/task.router.js` and `app.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Apply the `protect` middleware to all routes in `task.router.js`. Apply the Zod validation middleware to POST and PUT routes. Link the router in `app.js` as `/api/tasks`.
*   **Why:** Ensures users must be logged in and send valid data to use the task endpoints.

---

### Phase 6: Advanced API Features
Making the API robust enough for real-world scenarios where users have hundreds of tasks.

**Step 14: Implement Filtering in `getTasks`**
*   **What to work on:** Modify the `getTasks` controller.
*   **How to implement:** Read `req.query.status`. If it exists, add it to the Mongoose `find()` query object.
*   **Why:** Allows clients to request `/api/tasks?status=completed`.

**Step 15: Implement Sorting in `getTasks`**
*   **What to work on:** Modify the `getTasks` controller.
*   **How to implement:** Read `req.query.sortBy` (e.g., `dueDate:asc`). Split the string and apply it using Mongoose's `.sort()` method.
*   **Why:** Allows ordering tasks by date or creation time.

**Step 16: Implement Pagination in `getTasks`**
*   **What to work on:** Modify the `getTasks` controller.
*   **How to implement:** Extract `page` and `limit` from `req.query`. Calculate `skip = (page - 1) * limit`. Apply `.skip()` and `.limit()` to the Mongoose query.
*   **Why:** Prevents the server from sending massive payloads. If a user has 10,000 tasks, we send them 10 at a time.

---

### Phase 7: Refactoring & Error Handling
Cleaning up our code and making error responses consistent.

**Step 17: Create Global Error Handler Middleware**
*   **What to work on:** Create `src/middleware/error.middleware.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Write an Express error-handling middleware function `(err, req, res, next)`. Format Mongoose errors (duplicate keys, cast errors) into a standard JSON response. Include this at the very end of `app.js`.

**Step 18: Refactor Controllers with Async Handler**
*   **What to work on:** Update all controllers (`auth.controller.js` and `task.controller.js`).
*   **How to implement:** Wrap all controller functions in `express-async-handler`. Delete all `try/catch` blocks.
*   **Why:** Dramatically cleans up the codebase. Any thrown errors will automatically be passed to our new Global Error Handler.

---

### Phase 8: Production Readiness
Final touches to secure the application.

**Step 19: Apply Rate Limiting**
*   **What to work on:** Update `src/app.js`.
*   **How to implement:** Use `express-rate-limit` to limit requests to `/api` (e.g., max 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP).
*   **Why:** Prevents brute-force attacks and Denial of Service (DoS) attempts.

**Step 20: Final Testing & Walkthrough**
*   **What to work on:** API Testing.
*   **How to implement:** We will manually test the complete lifecycle: Register -> Login -> Create Task -> Get Tasks (with pagination/filters) -> Update -> Delete.
*   **Why:** Validates that all pieces of the architecture work together seamlessly.

## Verification Plan

We will verify our progress periodically during the execution phase by testing the API endpoints using Thunder Client, Postman, or cURL to ensure that:
1. Data is accurately inserted and fetched from the MongoDB database.
2. The authentication system successfully blocks unauthorized access to tasks.
3. Pagination and filtering logic successfully manipulate the returned data.
